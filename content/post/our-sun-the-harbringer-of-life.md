### "And _Maxwell_ said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light."

Perhaps a different quote from the one you remember, but nonetheless just as correct. James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is the man that is attributed with the discovery of the wave nature of light, arguably one of the most important discoveries in all of physics. This groundbreaking discovery unified the fields of electromagnetism and optics- which until that point were understood to be completely different fields. This led him to formulation of what would be known as the _Maxwell Equations_, the set of equations that govern the nature of light and describe its wave-like properties. This new view of light as wave became the accepted norm until two men, named Max Planck (1858-1947) & Albert Einstein (1875-1956), came along and revolutionized physics again. The two of them both helped foster a new understanding of light through Planck's _Quantum Theory_ and through Einstein's _Photoelectric Effect._ This new understanding of light told us that light acts like a _particle_, similar to a proton or an electron. The combination of both of these theories of light, although posing some interesting questions as to light’s nature, helped us as a species understand one of the most important entities in our little slice of the universe: The Sun.

The Sun is not your typical star. It is a main sequence star with a G2V stellar classification. This is just astrophysical jargon meaning that the sun is on the cooler side of the spectrum (compared to other stars, still really, _really,_ hot compared to us though). It is only about roughly \~5,700K (\~9,800F) in surface temperature. For reference, the temp of stars that are actually _hot_ can reach up to more than \~25,000K (\~44,540F). Yeah, that hot...

Discussing temperature is interesting and all, but you do not need me to sit here and tell you that the sun is hot. I think we all can piece that together without much scientific inquiry. The real magic of the sun comes from its deepest secrets. Something called the _P-P Chain_, or better known as the _Proton-Proton Chain_. This fusion reaction is the reason for all intelligent life, it _is_ the reason we are all here today, the reason you are able to sit here and read this article about the Sun. This reaction chain is responsible for so much, from providing the energy to the plants that the Romans needed when building one of the greatest empires on Earth, to providing energy to the solar panels on the James Webb Space-telescope that allows us to see deep into the universe's history. The Sun did it all, but more specifically, the P-P Chain did it all.

The P-P Chain, is a fusion reaction that occurs within our Sun’s core (as well as the core of other stars) in which ionized Hydrogen atoms (single protons with no electrons) combine to form ionized Helium atoms (a four proton atom with no electrons). When these atoms combine in such a way, there is _a lot_ of energy released. This energy is released in the form of high energy radiation (typically towards the gamma ray side of the spectrum). As the radiation is released, it bounces off of the plasma interior of the sun, which causes some of the radiation to lose energy. This loss of energy causes the frequency of the radiation to drop which then causes it to fall into the visible spectrum as it breaches the sun's surface. Perfect for the eyes of the many species of life here on Earth, particularly us humans.

The reason why such a reaction occurs in stars is mainly a product of the intense temperature that exists in the star’s core. The first part of the proton-proton chain is the dominant energy producing cycle at temperatures around 10-18 million Kelvin whereas the second and third parts of the chain occur at temperatures of 18-25 million K and greater than 25 million K respectively.

All of these processes occur in our Sun, even though our Sun _only_ has a core temperature of 15 million K...

But how can that be? Why can the Sun sustain its fusion reactions through all three P-P chain steps when common sense tells us this is impossible? People do not just teleport to the top of a mountain they are unable to climb. Alas, atomic-scale particles do _not_ behave like their macroscopic counterparts, not at all. They actually _can_ teleport to the top of figurative mountains. Particles in the Sun's core (where this reaction takes place) _are able_ to jump energy gaps needed for fusion to occur. This effect was discovered around the 1930's during the quantum revolution in physics which was mostly brought about by our friends Einstein & Planck who I mentioned above. The particular quantum effect in play here is called _quantum tunneling_.

Quantum tunneling occurs when an atomic-scale particle jumps across energy barriers, essentially nullifying any required energy for the action to occur. To put it more simply, imagine you are going to climb a mountain and you are standing at the bottom. To get to the top, you need to overcome the force of gravity and work against it to reach this new energy level. If you were an atomic-scale particle, quantum tunneling would suggest that you have a small, but not negligible, chance of randomly teleporting to the top of the mountain, without expending any energy or working against the force of gravity. _That_ is exactly what happens to the protons in the Sun that fuse into helium.

Protons in the Sun’s core can, through the wonders of quantum tunneling, get past the repulsive forces that they exert on each other and fuse to initiate the P-P chain.

This paints a very strange picture of reality for us. It is _not_ intuitive at all. But alas, these predictions of quantum theory are the only way that our lovely Sun can actually work. When you really consider it though, it really is such a profound concept. Not necessarily that fusion can occur in non-ideal circumstances through quantum tunneling, but when you consider the more human aspect of things. When you consider the idea that all of human life, and life in general, would be impossible without this random event that takes place deep within the Sun's core at the atomic scale. It is so profound that such a small event that is left up to chance is responsible for providing the light that has powered us for millennia and will continue to do so until our Suns inevitable death.
