### "And _Maxwell_ said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light."

Perhaps a different quote from the one you remember, but nonetheless just as correct. James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is the man that is attributed with the discovery of the wave nature of light, arguably one of the most important discoveries in all of physics. This groundbreaking discovery unified electromagnetism and optics- which until that point were understood to be completely different fields. This seemed to be accepted truth for a while, until two men named Max Planck (1858-1947) & Albert Einstein (1875-1956) came along and broke physics again. The two of them both helped foster a new understanding of light through Planck's _quantization_ theory of energy and through Einstein's _Photoelectric Effect._ This new understanding of light told us that light acts like a _particle_, similar to proton or an electron. Now the real question is, what does this mean? How can light be both a wave and a particle? What can we do with all this knowledge of light?

**_Maxwell's Equations of Electromagnetism (for reference):_**

$$\\nabla \\cdot E = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_{0}}$$

$$\\nabla \\cdot B = 0$$

$$\\nabla \\times E = -\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t}$$

$$\\nabla \\times H = J + \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial t}$$

The short answer is that it is neither a particle or a wave (this is a topic that is quite a deep rabbit hole into QFT). However, this does not matter necessarily for us. We know when light behaves as a particle and when it behaves as a wave, as such we are in pretty good standing to understand one of the most mysterious yet prevalent things that always seems to be watching us... our Sun.

The Sun is not your typical star. It is a main sequence star with a G2V stellar classification. This means that the sun is on the cooler side of the spectrum (compared to other stars, still really, _really,_ hot compared to us though). It is only about roughly \~5,700K (\~9,800F) in surface temperature and temperature For reference, the temp of _actually_ hot stars can reach up to more than \~25,000K (\~44,540F). Yeah, that hot...

Discussing temperature is interesting and all, but you do not need me to sit here and tell you that the sun is hot. I think we all can piece that together. The real magic of the sun comes from something called the "P-P Chain". This fusion reaction is the reason for all intelligent life, it _is_ the reason we are all here today. This reaction chain is responsible for so much, from providing the energy to the plants that the Romans needed when building the greatest empire on the moon, to providing energy to the solar panels on the James Webb Space-telescope that allows us to see deep into the universe's history. The Sun did it all.

The _P-P Chain_, or better known as the _Proton-Proton Chain_, is a fusion reaction that occurs within our Sun (as well as other stars) in which ionized Hydrogen atoms (single protons) combine to form Helium atoms (a four proton atom). When these atoms combine in such a way, there is _a lot_ of energy released. This energy is released in the form of high energy radiation (typically towards the gamma ray side of the spectrum). As the radiation is released, it bounces off of the plasma interior of the sun, which causes some of the radiation to lose energy. This loss of energy causes the frequency of the radiation to drop which then causes it to fall into the visible spectrum as it breaches the sun's surface. Perfect for the eyes of the many species of life here on Earth.

The reason why such a reaction occurs in stars is mainly a product of the intense temperature that exists in the sun's core. The part one of the proton-proton chain is the dominant energy producing cycle at temperatures around 10-18 million Kelvin where as the second and third parts of the chain occur at temperatures of 18-25 million K and greater than 25 million K respectively. However, all of these processes occur in our Sun, even though our Sun _only_ has a core temperature of 15 million K...

So what is up with that? Why can we see evidence (in the form of solar neutrino detection) of all the other branches of the P-P chain when common sense tells us this is impossible? People do not just teleport to the top of a mountain they are unable to climb. Alas, atomic-scale particles do not behave like their macroscopic counter parts. Particles in the Sun's core (where this reaction takes place) _are able_ to jump energy gaps needed for fusion to occur. This effect was discovered around the 1930's during the quantum revolution in physics which was mostly brought about by our friends Einstein & Planck. The particular quantum effect in play here is called _quantum tunneling_.

Quantum tunneling occurs when an atomic-scale particle jumps across energy barriers, essentially nullifying any required energy for the action to occur. To put it more simply, imagine you are climbing a mountain and you standing at the bottom. To get to the top, you need to overcome the force of gravity and work against it to reach this new energy level. If you were an atomic-scale particle, quantum tunneling would suggest that you have a small, but not negligible, chance of randomly teleporting to the top of the mountain, without expending any energy or working against the force of gravity. _That_ is exactly what happens to the protons in the sun that fuse into helium.
