"And _Maxwell_ said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light."...

Perhaps a different quote from the one you remember, but nonetheless just as correct. James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is the man that is attributed with the discovery of the wave nature of light, arguably one of the most important discoveries in all of physics. This discovery lead to the culmination of optics, electromagnetism, and electrostatics all into one new unified field- electrodynamics.
